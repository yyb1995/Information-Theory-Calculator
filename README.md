# Information-Theory-Calculator
## Brief Introduction
A useful GUI calculator in Information Theory learning written in MATLAB.This calculator is able to calculate some widely used parameters 
in Information Theory such as entropy,Markov steady state and channel capacity.It also has some demonstrations for BSC and Z-Shape channel.
The current version is V1.0.I will probably add some contents about coding into it later.
This is my first project published on GitHub ^_^ 
## How to use
Copy all files to your MATLAB workspace.Open main.m and click 'run' button in the toolbar.
